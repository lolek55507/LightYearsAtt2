  CMake Deprecation Warning at build/_deps/sfml-src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
  
  
  CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:441 (message):
    The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
    does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
    problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
    (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
    build/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Modules/FindVorbis.cmake:25 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
    build/_deps/sfml-src/cmake/Macros.cmake:279 (find_package)
    build/_deps/sfml-src/src/SFML/Audio/CMakeLists.txt:70 (sfml_find_package)
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
